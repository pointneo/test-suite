# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# How It Work

All of the testing suites are written inside self invoking function and will function after opening index.html. 

# Why Test Suite
TDD test driven development ensures that all functions are working in the way it was intended. 
## Written suites
1- RSS Feed
2-The menue
3-Intial Entries
4-New feed Selection
